# ARTPARTY!

## Overview:
THE PROBLEM: Kids can produce an impressive amount of artwork, which (beautiful as it may be) can quickly become overwhelming without a system to organize it. These creations tend to find their way into a box to gather dust (or into the trash if you’re a little more ruthless)--either way, it’s too easy for kids’ unique creations to simply disappear.

Enter ArtParty–a web app designed to take the overwhelm out of managing kids’ artwork. Artists, teachers, parents, and caregivers of all kinds can photograph artwork, upload it to ArtParty, add tags and details, curate featured pieces, and share artwork with others via their party page. 

## Features:
***Artists***
* Authenticated users can create an unlimited number of associated artists (their kids, students, or even just themselves).
* Each artwork can be associated with an artist as it is uploaded.
* Each artist has a basic profile page where all of their artworks live, serving as a portfolio that can continue to grow!

***Artworks***
* Users can upload an unlimited number of artworks to their account through a simple form.
* In addition to the uploaded artwork image, users can add artwork details including a title, medium, description, and date and age created.
* Each artwork can be associated with an artist, so it can always be found in the artist's portfolio page.
* Tags can be added to artworks to give them further context, and eventually, to aid in search and filter functionality (stretch goal to be added).
* A simple toggle can be clicked to give an artwork 'featured' status, adding it to the user's Party Page.

***Party Time!***
* Clicking the 'PARTY TIME!' button brings users to a special Party Page, which is essentially a digital art show where all artists' featured artworks are on display.
* This page will eventually have a unique url that can be shared out publicly to friends, grandparents, parents of students...anyone who may want to see all the best art in town (stretch goal to be added).



## Target User:
The target user for this application is anyone who makes art, or cares for kids who make art! Parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, nannies, babysitters, camp counselors, and other caregivers of all kinds will reap the benefits of this app--*hopefully,* spending less time figuring out where to stuff all the art being made and more time appreciating the best of it. Mental load: lightened.
