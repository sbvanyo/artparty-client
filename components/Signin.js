        <p>Art Party is a web app designed to take the overwhelm out of managing kidsâ€™ artwork. Never settle for stuffing creations in a dusty drawer again! Artists, teachers, parents, and caregivers of all kinds can archive artwork and share these creations with others via their public party page, giving them new life again and again.</p>
